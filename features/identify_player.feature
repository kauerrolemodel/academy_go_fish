Feature: Identify Player

  As the owner of the game
  In order to provide a pleasant user experience
  I want to identify a player in a friendly way before they play

  Scenario: Successful player identification
    Given a first time user
    When they identify themselves by name
    Then they're successfully associated with a new game and redirected to the game page
